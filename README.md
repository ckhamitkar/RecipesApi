In this project, we'll create endpoints to serve information about different recipes using ASP.NET Core 6. The .NET6 is the LTS (Long Term Support) release in the ASP.NET core series. We'll use the controller-based API development approach of .NET Core's WEB API framework for REST API development. SQL Server will be used to handle database-related operations. SQL Server is an RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) used for storing, managing, and retrieving data. We'll use Swagger (OpenAPI) to describe our REST API through the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger package.

Our API will consist of the following endpoints:

Post a new recipe
Get all recipes
Get a recipe by its title
Search recipes by ingredients
Search recipes by cuisines
Update an existing recipe
Delete a recipe
